# Lab4
This repository contains six Python programs that were part of a debugging lab activity. Each script was provided with various errors, which were identified and fixed. Below is a brief description of each file and the changes made:

time.py: This script calculates the time after a given wait period based on user input. The main corrections included fixing variable names, adding missing parentheses, and correcting a print statement.

time2.py: Similar to time.py, this script also calculates the time when an alarm goes off after a waiting period. Corrections addressed input typos, variable name consistency, and proper calculation.

pirate.py: A simple interactive program that asks the user for a password and provides different responses based on the input. Errors such as missing parentheses, improper condition handling, and syntax errors were fixed.

grading.py: This program calculates the average of three exam scores, assigns a corresponding letter grade, and informs whether the student is passing or failing. Fixes included correcting input handling, fixing logic errors in the if-elif conditions, and adjusting the print statements.

branching.py: A program that greets users based on their year of origin, with different messages for past, present, and future travelers. Syntax errors, logical operators, and missing conditions were corrected.

collection.py: This script creates a collection of famous authors and the years they passed away, printing them in a specific format. The primary fixes included correcting loop syntax, variable names, and using f-strings for cleaner output.
